          <h3 id="story"> Here are the uniterpreted lyrics of the story</h3>
          <div id="lyrics">
            Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
      We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.<br>
      All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon.
      In the middle of the road.
      And he said:<br>
            <div class="songQuote">
            "Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your soul." (soul)</div><br>
      Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
            And we each said. <div class="songQuote">"Okay."</div>
      And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
      Just so happened to be,
      The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.<br>
      Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
      One and one make two, two and one make three,
            It was destiny.</br>
      Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
      When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
      And the grass doth grow<br>
      Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
      Whip-crack went his whoopy tail,
      And the beast was done.<br>
            He asked us: <div class="songQuote">(snort)"Be you angels?"</div>
            And we said, <div class="songQupte">"Nay. We are but men. Rock!"</div>
      Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
      Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!<br>
      This is not The Greatest Song in the World, no.
      This is just a tribute.
      Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, no, no.<br>
      This is a tribute, oh, to The Greatest Song in the World,
      All right! It was The Greatest Song in the World,
      All right! It was the best muthafuckin' song the greatest song in the world.<br>
      And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
      The song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound
      Anything like this song.<br>
      This is just a tribute! You gotta believe it!
      And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.<br>
      Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
      So surprised to find you can't stop it.
      All right! All right!
          </div>
