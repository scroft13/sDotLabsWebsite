          If, like me, you are never really happy with someone else's idea of
          what your screen should look like, the idea that I can take someone
          else's functionality, give it my own tweak so that it looks just like
          I think it should look, with the colors that catch my eye. And the
          more that you are working in a text editor day in and day out, it
          definitely helps to know what colors are associated with which
          elements of the code, so when you are scanning the screen your eyes
          can look for certain colors if you are looking for certain elements.
          And it has a certain aesthetic appeal as well. While the documentation
          over at
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes" target=
          "_blank"class="link">the VS Code website</a> was a big help, I did
          find that I have to jump through a couple different sites to find all
          the information that I was looking for. So this is intended to be a
          complete beginners guide to creating your own VS Code theme. As a
          note, while I am pretty sure that doing this would be the same on a
          Windows or Linux Machine, I am using the Mac OS and so all the
          instructions will obviously be for the Mac.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Before you get started, I would highly recommend the extensions “Color
          Manager” by Roy Action, and Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, by CoenraadS.
          The Color Manager extension is extremely useful for this. You can
          create a palette to store all the colors you would like to use, and it
          makes it easy to switch out the colors to see what the affects are.
          The Bracket Pair Colorizer just makes your brackets nice and colorful,
          which I like.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Part 1 _ Overriding the Current Settings File</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The easiest way to get started is to open your settings.json file on
          with VS Code. Open VS Code and open a folder or workspace that has
          your latest project. It doesn’t matter what it is, but you will want
          something with all the different type of files that you normally work
          on. Once that is done, launch your Finder, types ‘settings.json’ into
          the search field, and then find the settings.json file that has the
          following path:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">
          $HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/Code/User/settings.json
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you click on a file, you can see the path in the bottom bar so
          that you know you are opening the correct one. Open that file with VS
          Code, it should add it to your current workspace, and it’s time to get
          started. See the clip below for help.
        </p>
        <br />
        <image src="blogimages/gif1.gif" class="gif"></image><br />
        <p>
          First, choose a theme that is similar to one that you would like to
          build - i.e. if you are building a dark theme, start with a dark
          theme, if you are building a light theme - start with a light theme.
          Launch the color theme picker with ⌘K ⌘T, choose one to model yours
          off of and it’s time to get started. I have decided to do a light
          colored theme, and am starting with the Light (Visual Studio), to get
          started with.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you have a wide enough screen to split VS into three panes, I found
          that to be a big time saver, with whatever language I was working on
          in the first pane, the settings.json file in the middle, and the Color
          Manager palette on the far right. Next, open up every pane or window
          within VS that you can - at the top of the screen fo to View >
          Appearance and click on everything that says “show” that is not
          currently checked. It is also probably best not to do it in
          full-screen so you can see changes to things like the Title Bar.
        </p>

          class="still-image"

          alt="all windows open with 3 panes"
        ></image><br />
        <p>
          To change any element, you just add
          <span class="span-code">“workbench.colorCustomizations”</span>
          followed by a colon and an open set of curly brackets. Inside the
          curly brackets you would select whatever element that you are trying
          to style, and the color that you want it to become. It does only
          accept colors in RGB Hex Values, so make sure that you aren’t using
          like an HSLA or anything.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The first items that I would recommend changing are the sidebar and
          the activity bar. For most items, you select the item with background
          color with the “.background” and the font/icon color with the
          “.foreground”. For example, the Activity Bar background is set with
          <span class="span-code">“activityBar.background”</span> and the icon
          colors are set with
          <span class="span-code">“activityBar.foreground”</span>. The first
          items that I recommend setting are your sidebar and activity bar. This
          will help you get the base colors set that your theme will be based
          on.
        </p>
        <br />

          class="carbonizeCode"
          src="blogimages/workbenchStart.png"
        ></image>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          If you have everything setup as recommended, to change a color to see
          how it will look, it is as easy as clicking on the color in the far
          last tab.
        </p>
        <br />

          src="blogimages/actionbarstyling.gif"
          alt="action bar styling gif"
          class="gif"
        ></image
        ><br />

        <p>
          Once you have your initial colors set-up in your palette, it is as
          easy as figuring our what element you want to change, targeting that
          element in the settings.json file, and telling it what color you want.
          You can check out all of the available elements that could be target
          over at the VS Code documentation <a href="" class="todo"></a>There
          are a lot of elements available. You can certainly just paste a
          element in there and change the color and see what it does. VS Code
          will automatically set the color to red so it is easy to spot. Theses
          are the codes that I ended up using for my theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <image
          class="carbonizeCode"
          alt="carbonize code"
          src="blogimages/workbenchFull.png"
        ></image>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Once you have everything set up just the way you like for all the
          elements, it’s time to get started with the actually words in the
          editor itself. Instead of setting these with the
          <span class="span-code">“workbench.colorCustomizations”</span> you set
          these with
          <span class="span-code">“editor.tokenColorCustomizations”</span>, but from
          there it is similar. If you only want to set the base
          variables, which will then be used by all the languages that use them,
          you can do that. I recommend setting these first and you can then
          override anything that doesn’t look right in the next section, the
          Text Mates Rules section. To get started, if you wanted to set the
          base comment color, it would look like this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <image
          class="carbonizeCode"
          alt="carbonize code"
          src="blogimages/editorToken.png"
        ></image>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Once you have set any base colors that you have set, you need to set
          the TextMates this is a little bit more complex. To get started, you
          set first tell your setting.json file that you are targeting the
          TextMate rules and then, using the “scope” keyword, you target the
          element you would like to change, and using the “foreground” keyword
          you change the color. So to get it started it looks like this:
        </p>
        <br />

        <image
          class="carbonizeCode"
          alt="carbonizeCode"
          src="blogimages/editorToken2.png"
        ></image>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Now all we need to do is figure out what element we want to change,
          paste it into the scope, and then change the color to what we want. So
          how do we do that? This is why we opened to some random project in the
          begining. If you work with html files the most, start there. That’s
          where we will start for this theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Let’s say we want to change inside the section tags. For example, if
          we want to change the “div” inside of the &ltdiv&gt we would highlight
          where it says “div” and then hit “⌃+⌥+⇧+I” on the keyboard. This will
          bring up VS Codes element inspector and tells us what the TextMate
          scope is. In the case of the div it will list
          <span class="span-code">“entity.name.tag.html”</span>
          as the first TextMate scope so this is the one that we will want to
          use. Copy and then paste that into the scope section we created
          earlier. Once we do that it will set it to the bright pink color we
          have list in the foreground. Just choose the color you want and we are
          done with that element. On to the next one.
        </p>
        <br />
        <image src="blogimages/stylingEntityTag.gif" class="gif"></image>
        <p>
          <br />
          Once you have set all your HTML elements like you want, the CSS
          elements are largely the same. Where we get into trouble like this is
          when you get into setting JavaScript elements. Because they use
          Semantic styling, they don’t change quite as easily. For a further
          read into what exactly that is, you can check out the documentation
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide" class="link">here</a>.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          For our purposes, we will just turn off semantic editing and then we
          can change the Javascript elements the same way we changed the HTML
          and CSS before that. To do that, at the bottom of your setting.json
          file(but inside the final curly bracket), just add:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">
          "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": { "enabled": false }
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once that is done, we change up all the JavaScript elements you want,
          as well as any other languages that you would like to edit the
          appearance of. So that’s it, right?
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          By now everything should look just like you want your theme to look,
          so you may be tempted to stop here. But we didn’t really create a
          theme. We just overid what the base themes settings were. If you
          change to a different color theme again, you will see, that not really
          everything changes. Go ahead, I’ll wait. You may notice some changes,
          but it isn’t working like it should be. In the next section, we will
          use these setting to create the actual theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Part 2 _ Creating The Theme From Our Setting</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The first thing we want to do is change the color theme back to the
          theme we started with, in this case the Light (Visual Studio) theme,
          and it’s time to create our theme. Bring up the Command Palette by
          hitting “⌘+⇧+P”’ on your keyboard and start typing “Developer:
          Generate Color Theme from Current setting.” Once you see it go ahead
          and click on it to create an untitled JSON file of the settings you
          just made. Go ahead and save it anywhere. It doesn’t matter where, we
          will just need the info inside of it later.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Once that is done, we need to clear out all our rules in the
          setting.json file, with the exception of the<span class="span-code">
            "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {"enabled": false}
          </span>
          rule. Everything should go back to the way it started, with the base
          theme that we started with. Now open up a Terminal window at the
          bottom of VS Code with the “ ⌃ + ` ” keystroke. (Yes, that is a
          backtick.)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you haven’t used it already, install the Yeoman and VS Code
          Extension Generator with:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">% npm install -g yo generator-code</div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once that is done, we need to create the color theme with Yeoman. To
          do that run:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">% yo code</div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Select “New Color Theme”, and then “No, start fresh.” Next, give it a
          name. I recommend that it ends with “Color Theme.” For our example, we
          will do “sDotLabs Light and Colorful Color Theme.” After that, for the
          identifier, use the same name, just make sure it’s in lower case and
          separated by hyphens. So, I’m going to use
          sDotLabs-light-and-colorful-color-theme. Next type give it a nice
          description, tell it what you want name you want displayed to the
          user, select a base theme, and then choose wether or not to initialize
          a git repo with it. That choice is entirely up to you, but I don’t see
          the need for it for a color theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Once that is done, open up finder and navigate to whatever folder you
          had opened to start the project. In that folder, it should have
          created a new folder named with whatever identified you used in the
          step above. In that folder should be another folder called “themes”
          and inside of it there is a single file ending with -color-theme.json.
          Open it with VS Code.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <image src="blogimages/gif2.gif" class="gif" autoplay></image>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Once in the file, delete everything from “type”:”light” to the end
          closing bracket. This is where that untitled-JSON file that we created
          earlier comes into play. Now copy everything in the JSON that we
          created from the settings and paste it into your theme’s JSON file.
          Save the file, quit VS Code and now your theme is done. One more task
          left.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now that our theme is created we need to put it in a place where VS
          Code will look for it. Open up your finder again and move the entire
          theme folder from whatever directory you were working in and move it
          to .vscode > extensions. Note that any folder or file that starts with
          a “.” Is a hidden folder and needs to be unhidden to find it. Just use
          the keystroke “CMD + Shift + .” And it will show you all the hidden
          files and folders. Use it again once you are done and you can hide the
          files and folders again.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now fire up VS Code once again, hit ⌘K ⌘T, and you should see your
          theme in the Color Theme Picker list. Give yourself a nice pat on the
          back, refill your coffee and then it’s time to buckle down. That
          code’s not going to write itself. At least for another couple years.
        </p>
