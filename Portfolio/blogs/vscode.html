          I tend to find myself never happy with someone else's idea of what my
          screen should look like. It is wonderful I can take someone else's
          functionality, and give it my own tweaks, so it looks exactly like I think
          it should appear, with colors that catch my eye. The more that
          you are working in a text editor, the more one knows what colors are associated with which elements of the code. When
          you are scanning the screen, your eyes can look for specific colors. And it has a certain aesthetic
          appeal, as well. While the documentation over at the
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            >VS Code website</a
          >
          was a huge help, I did find that I had to jump through a couple
          different sites to find all the information that I was looking for. I compiled my knowledge and created a complete beginner's guide to creating your
          own VS Code theme. As a note, while I am confident that doing this
          would be the same on a Windows or Linux Machine, I am using the Mac OS,
          and all instructions will be for the Mac.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Before you get started, I would highly recommend the extension “Color
          Manager” by Roy Action, and Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, by CoenraadS.
          The Color Manager extension is extremely useful for this. You can
          create a palette to store all colors you would like to use, and it
          makes it easy to switch out the colors to identify what the effects
          are. The Bracket Pair Colorizer makes your brackets bright and
          colorful.

          Part 1 _ Overriding the Current Settings File
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The easiest way to get started is to open your settings.json file with
          VS Code. Open VS Code and open a folder or workspace that has your
          latest project. It doesn’t matter what it is, but you will want
          something with all the different types of files you normally work on.
          Once that is done, launch your Finder, type ‘settings.json’ into the
          search field, and then find the settings.json file that has the
          following path:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">
          $HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/Code/User/settings.json
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you click on a file, you should see the path in the bottom bar. This indicated
          that you know you are opening the correct file. Open that file with VS
          Code, it should add it to your current workspace, and it’s time to get
          started. Watch the clip below for help.
          <br />
          <image src="blogimages/gif1.gif" class="gif modal"></image><br />
        
        
        
          First, choose a similar theme to the theme you are going to build -
          i.e. if you are building a dark theme, start with a dark theme, if you
          are building a light theme - start with a light theme. Launch the
          color theme picker with ⌘K ⌘T, then choose one to model yours off of. I have decided to do a light colored theme,
          and am starting with the Light (Visual Studio).
       
        <br />
        <br />
        
          If you have a wide enough screen to split VS into three panes, it will
          be a big time saver; with whatever language you are working on in the
          first pane, the settings.json file in the middle, and the Color
          Manager palette on the far right. Open up every pane or window
          within VS that you can - at the top of the screen, go to View >
          Appearance and click on everything that says “show” that is not
          currently checked. It is also probably best not to do it in
          full-screen so you can discern changes to items like the Title Bar.
        </p>
        <br />
        <image
          class="still-image modal"
          src="blogimages/everything open.png"
          alt="all windows open with 3 panes"
        ></image
        ><br />
        <p>
          To change any element, you simply add
          <span class="span-code">“workbench.colorCustomizations”</span>
          followed by a colon and an open set of curly brackets. Inside the
          curly brackets you would select whatever element that you are trying
          to style, and the color you want it to become. It does only accept
          colors in RGB Hex Values, so make sure that you aren’t using HSLA or anything else.<br />
          If you aren't sure which is which that fine. In short and RGB color is a color that is called with a '#' and then is followed by six numbers, tranditionally. 
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The first items that I would recommend changing are the sidebar and
          the activity bar. For most items, you select the item with background
          color with the “.background” and the font/icon color with the
          “.foreground”. For example, the Activity Bar background is set with
          “activityBar.background” and the icon colors are set with
          “activityBar.foreground”. The first items that I recommend setting are
          your sidebar and activity bar. This will help you get the base colors
          set that your theme will be based on.
        </p>
        <br />

          class="carbonizeCode modal"
          src="blogimages/workbenchStart.png"
        ></image>
        <br /><br />

        <p>
          If you have everything set up as recommended, to change a color to
          discover how it will look is as simple as clicking on the color in the
          far last tab.
        </p>
        <br />

          alt="action bar styling gif"
          class="gif modal"
        ></image
        ><br />

        <p>
          Once you have your initial colors set-up in your palette, decide which element you want to change, target that element in the
          settings.json file, and tell it what color you want. You can check out
          all the available elements that could be targeted over at the
          <a
            href="http://https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color"
            class="link"
            target="_blank"
          >
            VS Code documentation.</a
          >
          There are many elements available. You can certainly paste an element
          in there and change the color and see what it does. VS Code will
          automatically set the color to red, so it is easy to spot. Theses are
          the codes that I ended up using for my theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <image
          class="carbonizeCode modal"
          alt="carbonize code"
          src="blogimages/workbenchFull.png"
        ></image>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Once you have everything set up just the way you like for all the
          elements, it’s time to get started with the actually words in the
          editor itself. Instead of setting these with the
          “workbench.colorCustomizations” you set these with
          “editor.tokenColorCustomizations”, but from there it is similar. If
          you only want to set the base variables, which will then be used by
          all the languages that use them, you can do that. I recommend setting
          these first and you can then override anything language specific that
          isn't how you would like it in the following section, the Text Mates
          Rules section. To get started, if you wanted to set the base comment
          color, it would look like this:
        </p>
        <br />
        <image
          class="carbonizeCode modal"
          alt="carbonize code"
          src="blogimages/editorToken.png"
        ></image>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Once you have set all base colors you wanted, you need to set
          the TextMates. This is a little bit more complex. You
          first tell your setting.json file that you are targeting the TextMate
          rules and then, using the “scope” keyword, you target the element you
          would like to change, and using the “foreground” keyword you change
          the color. To get it started it looks like this:
        </p>
        <br />

        <image
          class="carbonizeCode modal"
          alt="carbonizeCode"
          src="blogimages/editorToken2.png"
        ></image>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Now all we need to do is figure out what element we want to change,
          paste it into the scope, and then change the color to what we want. So
          how do we do that? This is why we opened to some random project in the
          beginning. If you work with HTML files the most, start there. That’s
          where we will start for this theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Let’s say we want to change inside the section tags. For example, if
          we want to change the “div” inside of the &ltdiv&gt we would highlight
          where it says “div” and then hit “⌃+⌥+⇧+I” on the keyboard. This will
          bring up the VS Codes element inspector and tell us what the TextMate
          scope is. In the case of the div it will list “entity.name.tag.html”
          as the first TextMate scope, so this is the one that we will want to
          use. Copy and then paste that into the scope section we created
          earlier. Once we do it will set it to the bright pink color we have
          listed in the foreground. Then, choose the color you want, and we are
          done with that element. On to the next one.
        </p>
        <br />
        <image src="blogimages/stylingEntityTag.gif" class="gif modal"></image>
        <p>
          <br />
          Once you have set all your HTML elements like you want, the CSS
          elements are largely the same. Where we get into trouble is
          when setting JavaScript elements. They use
          Semantic styling, which doesn’t change as easily. For a further read into
          what exactly that is, you can check out the documentation
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide"
            class="link"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          For our purposes, we will turn off semantic editing, and then we can
          change the Javascript elements the same way we changed the HTML and
          CSS before that. To do that, at the bottom of your setting.json
          file(but inside the final curly bracket), add:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">
          "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": { "enabled": false }
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once that is done, we change up all the JavaScript elements you want,
          as well as any other language that you would like to edit the
          appearance of. So that’s it, right?
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          By now, everything should look like you want your theme to appear, so
          you may be tempted to stop here. But we didn’t create a theme. We
          simply overrode what the base theme settings were. If you change to a
          different color theme again, you will note, that not everything
          changes. Go ahead, I’ll wait. You may notice some changes, but it
          isn’t working like it should be. In the next section, we will use
          these settings to create the actual theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 class="part-title">Part 2 _ Creating The Theme From Our Setting</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          The first thing we want to do is change the color theme back to the
          theme we started with, in this case the Light (Visual Studio) theme,
          and it’s time to create our theme. Bring up the Command Palette by
          hitting “⌘+⇧+P”’ on your keyboard and start typing “Developer:
          Generate Color Theme from Current Setting.” Once you see it go ahead
          and click on it to create an untitled JSON file of the settings you
          just created. Go ahead and save it anywhere. It doesn’t matter where,
          but we will need the info inside of it later.ater.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Once that is done, we need to clear out all our rules in the
          setting.json file, except for the
          "editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {"enabled": false} rule.
          Everything should go back to the way it started, with the base theme
          that we started with. Now open up a Terminal window at the bottom of
          VS Code with the “ ⌃ + ` ” keystroke. (Yes, that is a backtick/back
          quote.)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you haven’t used it already, install the Yeoman and VS Code
          Extension Generator with:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">% npm install -g yo generator-code</div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once that is done, we need to create the color theme with Yeoman. To
          do that run:
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="code">% yo code</div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Select “New Color Theme”, and then “No, start fresh.” Then, give it a
          name. I recommend it ends with “Color Theme.” For our example, we will
          do “sDotLabs Light and Colorful Color Theme.” After that, for the
          identifier, use the same name, just make sure it’s in lower case and
          separated by hyphens. So, I’m going to use
          sDotLabs-light-and-colorful-color-theme. Then, give it a clear
          description, tell it what name you want displayed to the user, select
          a base theme, and then choose wether or not to initialize a git repo
          with it. That choice is entirely up to you, but I don’t foresee the
          need for it for a color theme.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Once that is done, open up finder and navigate to whatever folder you
          had opened to start the project. In that folder, it should have
          created a new folder named with whatever identified you used in the
          step above. In that folder should be another folder called “themes”
          and inside of it there is a single file ending with -color-theme.json.
          Open it with VS Code.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <image src="blogimages/gif2.gif" class="modal gif" autoplay></image>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          Once in the file, delete everything from “type”:”light” to the end
          closing bracket. This is where that untitled-JSON file that we created
          earlier comes into play. Now copy everything in the JSON that we
          created from the settings and paste it into your theme’s JSON file.
          Save the file, quit VS Code and now your theme is done. One more task
          left.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now that our theme is created we need to put it in a place where VS
          Code will look for it. Open up your finder again and move the entire
          theme folder from whatever directory you were working in and move it
          to .vscode > extensions. Note that any folder or file that starts with
          a “.” is a hidden folder and needs to be unhidden to find it. Use the
          keystroke “CMD + Shift + .” And it will show you all the hidden files
          and folders. Use it again once you are done and you can hide the files
          and folders again.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Now fire up VS Code once again, hit ⌘K ⌘T, and you should notice your
          theme in the Color Theme Picker list. Select your theme and make sure
          everything looks correct. Give yourself a nice pat on the back, refill
          your coffee and then it’s time to buckle down. That code’s not going
          to write itself. At least not for another couple years.
