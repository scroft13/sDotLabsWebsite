                    If, like me, you are never really happy with someone else's idea of what your screen should look like, the idea that I can take someone else's functionality, give it my own tweak so that it looks just like I think it should look, with the colors that catch my eye. And the more that you are working in a text editor day in and day out, it definitely helps to know what colors are associated with which elements of the code, so when you are scanning the screen your eyes can look for certain colors if you are looking for certain elements. And it has a certain aesthetic appeal as well. While the documention over at <a href="">the VS Code website</a> was a big help, I did find that I had to jump through a couple different sites to find all the information that I was looking for. So this is intended to be a complete beginners guide to creating your own VS Code theme. As a note, while I am pretty sure that doing this would be the same on a Windows or Linux Machine, I am using the Mac OS and so all the instructions will obviously be for the Mac.
